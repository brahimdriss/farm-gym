# FarmGym

FarmGym is a Farming Environment Gym factory intended to model sequential decision-making on farms seen as dynamical system with many entities interacting.
FarmGym offers the possibility to build ad-hoc games by specifying a farm with different entities, different rules and scores.
This enables to consider from very simple to highly complicated environments. 
The following [user-guide](FarmGym.pdf) contains detailed presentation of FarmGym.

## Getting started

The following [user-guide](FarmGym.pdf) contains detailed presentation of FarmGym. 

### Illustrative notebooks

As a first illustration of farm-gym, one can look at the following colab notebooks: the first is an "Interactive farm" [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vUkYnRyxNEAgd8cuZKRn6iduroSYSj8O?usp=sharing) the second is a notebook in which we train a basic PPO agent on the same farm [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AauxwIGebI11fF1sJgZp9nYx5M1SoPfV?usp=sharing). The first notebook allow a user to be the agent, by inputing manually the actions to play on a 1x1 farm containing beans with pests and weeds. The second notebook is a very basic implementation of PPO on the same farm. These notebooks were made using [rlberry-farms](https://github.com/farm-gym/rlberry-farms) which is a collection of two very simple farms on which one can try some classical RL algorithms with [rlberry](https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry) library. 


### Packages
It is recommended to use gym version >= 0.25.2, due to better support of dictionaries to define Spaces.

### Entities 
Minimal entities to define a farm are the Weather, the Soil and the Plant. 
Additional entities can be added, such as Birds, Pests, Weeds, or Facilities (e.g. Scarescrow, Hedge) and Fertilizers.
Each entity offers a list of actions made available to the learner.

### Rules 
The rules typically specify the initial and stopping conditions of the game, the subset of actions allowed for the considered game,
or the number of actions allowed each day.

### Score
The score may incorporate several features such as yield, biodiversity, resource usage, and specifies the cost of each action.

### Games
 Specifying various entities, rules and scores enables to generate various games. 
 FarmGym comes with a bunch of predefined games that can be seen as illustrative examples to build user-defined games.

### Minimal environment
```python
import gym
from farmgym.v2.games.farms_1x1.clay_corn.farm import env

farm = env()

is_done = False
while not is_done:
    obs, reward, is_done, info = farm.step(farm.action_space.sample())
```
Note however that a FarmGym environment implements AO-MDP (Actively-observed Markov Decision Processes), and not just PO-MDP.
This can be recasted into a two-stage PD-MDP, alternating between observation steps and intervention steps.
Using the gym PO-MDP approach, the action space combines all observation-actions and intervention-actions, 
so that asking random actions may generate observation-actions at intervention steps or
intervention-actions at observation steps. 

Alternatively, one may want to separate between observation and intervention times, and asks random observation-action
or random interention-action at the appropriate time. 
We provide such an example below, here using the farmgym_step function instead of step.
```python
import gym
from farmgym.v2.games.farms_1x1.clay_corn.farm import env

farm = env()

is_done = False
while not is_done:
    observation_schedule = []
    observation_schedule.append(farm.random_allowed_observation())
    obs1, _, _, info = farm.farmgym_step(observation_schedule)
    obs_cost = info['observation cost']

    intervention_schedule = []
    intervention_schedule.append(farm.random_allowed_intervention())
    obs2, reward, is_done, info = farm.farmgym_step(intervention_schedule)
    int_cost= info["intervention cost"]
```
The difference between step and farmgym_step is the format of the action given as input.
Any gym action can be converted into its corresponding farm_gym format using farm.gymaction_to_farmgymaction.

### Logging

To know what happened in the farm at time of death, use the debug log-level

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Rendering
The basic rendering option is to print a farm, which output a text representation of the farm with all entities and available actions.
When rendering is called with farm.render(), the environment produces an image representing the farm at the current day.
Once a game is done, it is possible to assemble all these images into a movie, calling the method generate_video. 
It is also possible to generate a gif using the method generatee_gif.
Further, we store all these figures and the movie in a sub-folder for convenience.
```python
import gym
from farmgym.v2.games.farms_1x1.clay_corn.farm import env
from farmgym.v2.farm import generate_video

import os
import time
time_tag = time.time()
os.mkdir("run-" + str(time_tag))
os.chdir("run-" + str(time_tag))

farm = env()

is_done = False
while not is_done:
    farm.render()
    obs, reward, is_done, info = farm.step(farm.action_space.sample())
generate_video(image_folder='.', video_name='farm.avi')
```

### Monitoring
A FarmGym environment typically comes with many states. It is possible for the developer to monitor such variables.
It is possible to do usingthe method farm.add_monitoring(var), where var is the list of considered variables.

### Complete gym example
We detail another way to try an environment below. 
The method register_all scans for all environments defined in farmgym and register them to gym.
It outputs the list of names of each environment. 
Then, the method run from  farmgym.v2.games.rungame runs a complete game,
collects rewards and costs, gather all rendered images if asked, and output all this in a sub-folder.
It also tests is the environment is compatible with gym.

```python
import gym
from farmgym.v2.games.register_all import register_all
from farmgym.v2.games.rungame import run_randomactions

env_list=register_all()

env = gym.make(env_list[2],100)
farm = env.unwrapped
run_randomactions(farm,max_steps=100,render=True, monitoring=False)
```

You can find further examples in the tests folder.


## Plants

You can grow several plants. 

Beans

## Examples
### Basic farm
This is an example of a 1x1 field with a Weather, Soil and Plant entity. The Plant is Corn and Soil is Clay. 
Here the learner succesfully harvest, although perhaps a little early.

    <div align="center">A basic farm</div>
</p>

### More complex farm
Below is an example of a more complex 3x4 farm, with Weather, Soil, Plant and Fertilizer entities.
The Plant is a Corn and soil is clay.
<p align="center">
<img src="Readme_figs/farm_3x4_clay_corn_fertilizer.gif?raw=true">
    <div align="center">A more complex farm</div>
</p>

Below is another example of a more complex 3x4 farm, with Weather, Soil, Plant, Weeds but also Herbicides entities.
The Plant is a Tomato and  soil is sand. Note that here, the learner has waited too long and the tomatoes have rotten before being harvested.

<p align="center">
<img src="Readme_figs/farm_3x4_sand_tomato_weeds_fail.gif?raw=true">
    <div align="center">A more complex farm</div>
</p>

Another example when the plant is Beans and the soil is clay. Here the learner has harvested at the correct time.

    <div align="center">A more complex farm</div>
</p>

### Difficult farm game
Finally, below is a harder game, showing  a 3x4 farm with Weather, Soil, Plant, Fertilizer, but also Birds, Pests, Weeds, Pollinators entities.
There are also Facility entity, which enables to put a scarecrow and Cide entity.
Here the random agent fails due to combination of all these effects.
